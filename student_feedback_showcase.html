    <p>After each Sway discussion and Understanding Quiz, students share their experiences through our post-chat survey. Their responses reveal how Sway creates space for thoughtful expression, encourages clear thinking and argumentation, and facilitates meaningful peer connectionsâ€”even for students who typically remain quiet in traditional classroom settings. Browse below to discover what students appreciate most about their Sway experience.</p>

        <p>This was my first time using Sway, and the experience was great! I like having discussions through Sway more than I like having them in the classroom specifically because I'm a bit shy. I'm introverted and reserved, so I often find myself hesitant to share my honest opinion in the classroom environment. Sway has given me the opportunity to share my honest opinion without feeling like I will be judged.</p>
